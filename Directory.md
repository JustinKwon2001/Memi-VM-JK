# Memi
an app that acts like a reminiscence therapist. By Veronikah McClelland and Justin Kwon.

## Main Folder
- Memi.pdf: a poster showing what Memi is
- Memi.txt: a document showing what programs we used to build Memi
- Memi_Code.zip: a folder with the **code**, database and README.md inside. Once opened, open the **Memi_Code** folder using Visual Studio and if you have the packages installed in the README.md file, type '**streamlit run your pathname/Memi_Code_/Memi.py**' inside the terminal to get Memi running.
