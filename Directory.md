# Memi
an app that acts like a reminiscence therapist. By Veronikah McClelland and Justin Kwon.

## Main Folder
- Memi.pdf: a poster showing what Memi is
- Memi.txt: a document showing what programs we used to build Memi
- Memi_Code.zip: a folder with the **code**, database and README.md inside. Once downloaded, open the **Memi_Code** folder using Visual Studio. Ensure you have the packages installed in the README.md file. In Memi.py, make sure **openai.api_key** is equal to your OpenAI API Key, as changing the .env file won't work. Finally, in your terminal, type *streamlit run '**your pathname/Memi_Code/Memi.py**'* inside the terminal to get Memi running.
