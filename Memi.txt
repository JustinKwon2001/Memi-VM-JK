- MEMI: Documentation -
by Veronikah McClelland and Justin Kwon

For our app Memi, we used a plethora of coding and AI resources in order to help the finished product function.
Firstly, in order to help build a simple chatbot, we used ChatGPT 3.5 for the back-end development.
For front-end development we used Streamlit, as it is an effective tool in regard to building websites under a short amount of time.
For Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we used Audio Recorder Streamlit to take in input, and OpenAI's Whisper model to decode it.
In order to make the app more accessible, we allowed the chatbot to have an audio feature to speak through the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) plugin.
To specify keywords, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Spacy plugin.
To summarise conversations, we used LangChain.
Finally, for Memi to implement sample data, we used Pandas, which serves data analysis.
